Jacob Pipkin is the original author of all of the sbotools except for
sbohints and sboremove. For all the changes that have been made, the
look-and-feel of sbotools is still remarkably similar to his initial
commit in 2012.

Luke Williams made important contributions to early sbotools, most
notably writing the original sboremove.

Andreas Guldstrand maintained sbotools from late 2015 through 2019. He
made a number of important changes, including spinning off sboremove as
a module and the now-familiar /usr/sbo/repo directory structure. Reverse
dependency search, non- default git branch use and reporting out-of-tree
packages in sbocheck were planned feature additions of his originally.

drgibbon wrote the original zsh completions, without which the bash
completions would surely never have been added. He has been active on
the Issue page with advice for users and helpful feedback.

Other pre-fork code contributors include 9m9 (better wget behavior) and
pedrormjunior (Perl compatibility fix).

Slack Coder, the maintainer of sbotools2, has been a friendly and
helpful correspondent. Although they are implemented differently here,
GPG verification and non-root permission for the less-destructive
parts of sbotools were his ideas. He also suggested changing to the
MIT License and provided other useful feedback.

Finally, a good number of users have made valuable reports and feature
requests over the years, both before and after this sbotools repository
was forked:

Charadon (requested --mass-rebuild and development man pages)
dchmelik (reported diligently on sbocheck problems)
dcjud (requested an installable sbotools.conf)
drbeco (requested a blacklist and strict version-up)
Geremias (originally reported the info parse bug before version 3.3)
januscan (requested strict version-up)
qunying (requested build number upgrade notification)
tuxuser1 (reported the overwritten source file bug)

This file is incomplete; more research about early sbotools needs to be
done. Please let me know if you should be in this file (or README.md)
and you are not!

.SH NAME
.P
sboclean - clean files left around by sbotools.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
sboclean [-h|-v] [-dwi] [-o ALL|package]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
sboclean is used to clean files left around by sbotools, such as saved options (in /var/log/sbotools), downloaded source files ("distfiles"), or work directories under /tmp/SBo (or $TMP) and, for compat32 installs, under /tmp (or $TMP). Note that if not run with the -i flag, sboclean will remove anything in the distfiles or /tmp/SBo (or $TMP) folders and any /tmp/package-*-compat32 (or $TMP/package-*-compat32) directories with extreme prejudice. One of -d, -w or -o must be specified for this script to do anything.

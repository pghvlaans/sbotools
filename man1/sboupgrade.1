.SH NAME
.P
.B
sboupgrade
- install or upgrade SlackBuilds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
sboupgrade [-h|-v]
.P
sboupgrade [-c TRUE|FALSE] [-d TRUE|FALSE] [-j #|FALSE] \\
           [-b TRUE|FALSE] [-fiprz] --all|sbo_name (sbo_name)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
.B
sboupgrade
is used to upgrade SlackBuilds. If the
.B
-r
flag is not specified,
.B
sboupgrade
will pull the list of requirements from the
.I
info
file for any specified SlackBuild. This is a recursive
operation over all dependencies.
.B
sboinstall
will offer to install any non-installed dependencies in
the build queue. This program will not handle circular
dependencies.
.P
.I
README
files are parsed for
.B
groupadd
and
.B
useradd
commands, and
.B
sboinstall
will offer to run them prior to building. If the
.I
README
is judged to document options in
.I
KEY=VALUE
form, a prompt for setting options will appear. Any
build options, whether passed interactively or in a
template, will be saved to
.I
/var/log/sbotools
when the SlackBuild runs.
.P
Please note that saved build options will not be displayed
when
.B
CLASSIC
is set to
.B
TRUE\fR\
\&. See
.B
sboconfig(1)
or
.B
sbotools.conf(5)\fR\
\&.
.P
.B
sboupgrade
will attempt to download the sources from the
.I
DOWNLOAD
or
.I
DOWNLOAD_x86_64
variables in the
.I
info
file. If
either the download or the md5sum check fails, a new
download will be attempted from
.UR ftp://slackware.uk/sbosrcarch/
.UE
as a fallback measure. The
.B
--all
flag may be passed to upgrade all eligible SlackBuilds
simultaneously.
.SH OPTIONS
.P
.B
-h|--help
.RS
Show help information.
.RE
.P
.B
-v|--version
.RS
Show version information.
.RE
.P
.B
-b|--build-ignore (FALSE|TRUE)
.RS
If
.B
TRUE\fR\
\&, do not perform upgrades unless the
version number differs. By default, upgrades
also occur when the build number differs.
This setting and
.B
--force
are not the same;
.B
--force
will initiate upgrades even if the
build number is unchanged. This overrides the
.B
BUILD_IGNORE
setting in
.B
sbotools.conf(5)\fR\
\&.
.RE
.P
.B
-c|--noclean (FALSE|TRUE)
.RS
If
.B
TRUE\fR\
\&, do not clean working directories after building.
These are the build and
.I
package-(sbo)
directories under
.I
/tmp/SBo
(or
.I
$TMP\fR\
). Cleaning these directories can be set as default
via the
.B
sboconfig(1)
command. See also
.B
sbotools.conf(5)\fR\
\&. This option overrides the default.
.RE
.P
.B
-d|--distclean (FALSE|TRUE)
.RS
If
.B
TRUE\fR\
\&, then remove the source archives after building. They
are retained in
.I
SBO_HOME/distfiles
by default. The package archive (in
.I
/tmp
by default) will also be removed. This option can be set as default via the
.B
sboconfig(1)
command. See also
.B
sbotools.conf(5)\fR\
\&. This option overrides the default.
.RE
.P
.B
-f|--force
.RS
Force an upgrade, even if the installed version and
build number are equal to the
.B
slackbuilds.org
version.
.RE
.P
.B
-i|--noinstall
.RS
Do not install the package at the end of the build process.
It will be left in
.I
/tmp
(or
.I
$OUTPUT\fR\
) if
.B
DISTCLEAN
is
.B
FALSE\fR\
\&. Packages are retained in
.B
PKG_DIR
if so defined regardless of
.B
DISTCLEAN\fR\
\&. See
.B
sboconfig(1)
and
.B
sbotools.conf(5)\fR\
\&.
.RE
.P
.B
-j|--jobs (FALSE|#)
.RS
If numerical, pass to the
.B
-j
argument when a SlackBuild invoking
.B
make
is run.
.RE
.P
.B
-p|--compat32
.RS
Create a -compat32 package on multilib x86_64 systems.
This requires the
.B
compat32-tools
package by Eric Hameleers. Please note that this operation
is not necessarily foolproof, and is unsupported by anyone
in principle. As a best practice,
.B
--compat32
should be combined with
.B
--noinstall
so that the contents of the package can be inspected prior
to installation. If the base package and compat32 package are
to be built at the same time, ensure that the
.B
DISTCLEAN
option is set to
.B
FALSE.
GitHub Issues are welcome in case of unexpected failure.
.RE
.P
.B
-r|--nointeractive
.RS
Bypass all user prompts and all dependency resolution for
the requested SlackBuilds. Unless it is obvious that dependency
resolution and build options are not required, this option should
not be used with
.B
sboupgrade\fR\
\&.
.RE
.P
.B
-z|--force-reqs
.RS
In combination with
.B
--force\fR\
\&,
rebuild dependencies that do not require upgrades as well.
.RE
.P
.B
--all
.RS
Upgrade all installed SlackBuilds that are eligible for
upgrades. This takes the
.B
BUILD_IGNORE
setting into account. See
.B
sboconfig(1)
and
.B
sbotools.conf(5)\fR\
\&.

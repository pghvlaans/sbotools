sbotools3 (ports-like interface to slackbuilds.org)

sbotools3 is the continuation of sbotools. It is a set of perl scripts
providing a ports-like automation interface to slackbuilds.org. Its
features include requirement handling and the ability to handle 32-bit
and compat32 builds on multilib x86_64 systems.

There are man pages for each of the sbo* commands, more documentation,
as well as online versions of the man pages, can be found at the
project's homepage.

sbotools3 bundles the required Perl module Sort::Versions with. This 
does not interfere with a copy installed from the CPAN or from
slackbuilds.org.

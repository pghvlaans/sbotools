Version 4.1.3 TODO

* Improve user and group detection.

  Coverage is still not perfect; some required users and groups that
  would otherwise be missed appear to be contained in the SlackBuilds
  themselves. If they could be picked up with more comprehensive tests
  on the README* files, that would be preferable, however.

  STATUS: Overhauled with better results. Checking the SlackBuild
  suffices for most UID/GID-dependent builds, so this is now done first.
  The build options file is respected for those scripts that accept
  variable user and group names and ID numbers.

* Better handle exotic version numbers.

  At least two scripts currently add (or potentially add) trailers to
  the package version that are not reflected in the info file and are
  not the running kernel version.

  STATUS: Invalid. The scripts in question actually alter the package
  names; I highly doubt there is a reasonable way to deal with this
  problem.

* Explore ways to distinguish one-click options in sbotool Settings.

TO DO

* Release version 2.8 (but probably sbotools3 1.0)
* Punctuation and grammar fixes, especially for on-screen messaging

MAYBE NEXT TIME

* Install a default configuration file (would require a rework of sboconfig)

DONE

* Save the build options when the SlackBuild runs (all cases); clean with sboclean
* sbocheck reports out-of-tree _SBo SlackBuilds (i.e., removed ones) (RE #70)
* Detect BUILD bumps; optionally, upgrade (RE #68, #93)
* Configurable git branch selection (RE #69)
* Use git for default repos; 15.0-compatible default repo
* Add bash completions
* Update the zsh completions

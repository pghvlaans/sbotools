* Add a hint category for specifying pre-build commands

  Users may wish to run commands other than useradd and groupadd before
  building certain scripts. One usecase that comes to mind is sourcing
  profile scripts. This will be doable with either sbohints or direct
  sbotools.hints editing.

  Status: Change of plans; there is instead a new option ETC_PROFILE. If
          TRUE, source any executable *.sh script in /etc/profile.d before
          building each SlackBuild in the queue. This obviates the main
          usecase for a pre-build command hint. Very convenient if a
          dependency installs a new profile script, but the existing
          default behavior will probably stay the way it is.

* Add a reverse dependency build tester.

  For script maintainers. This will likely take the form of a separate
  out-of-PATH script that calls sboinstall one or more times, depending on
  the target.

* Rebuild all scripts in a series.

  Potentially useful for the python, perl, ruby and haskell series.

* sboremove: With --alwaysask, show all 'needed' reverse dependencies

  "sboremove --alwaysask" currently only reports the first level of
  installed reverse dependencies. Reporting all of them would be more
  helpful.

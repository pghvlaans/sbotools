* Add a message about a missing LOCAL_OVERRIDES directory

  After the sbofind bugfix in d495332, Slack Coder suggested that users
  be alerted to a missing overrides directory. In this repository, this
  will probably take the form of a warning in sbocheck, sboinstall,
  sboupgrade, sbofind and sboremove.

* Add a hint category for specifying pre-build commands

  Users may wish to run commands other than useradd and groupadd before
  building certain scripts. One usecase that comes to mind is sourcing
  profile scripts. This will be doable with either sbohints or direct
  sbotools.hints editing.

* Allow for separate compat32 hints

  Currently, hints for any base package automatically apply to the
  corresponding compat32 package. Keep this as the default behavior, but
  also respect separate hints for the compat32 package, if present.

* sbofind: Add a flag to list all reverse dependencies

  This is potentially useful for maintenance-related testing.

* Merge sboinstall and sboupgrade in a backward-compatible way

  These two scripts have always been similar, and the changes between
  version 3.4.2 and version 3.5 made them more similar still. Commit
  3893bf0 is a good illustration: One change in how pointless compat32
  builds are skipped in the queue required nearly identical adjustments.
  The most likely solution is to turn sboinstall and sboupgrade into
  frontends to a new module in SBO::App, along the lines of sboremove.
  Current options will be retained. This will need to happen before
  separate compat32 hints cna be implemented.

* Add a message about a missing LOCAL_OVERRIDES directory

  After the sbofind bugfix in d495332, Slack Coder suggested that users
  be alerted to a missing overrides directory. In this repository, this
  will probably take the form of a warning in sbocheck, sboinstall,
  sboupgrade, sbofind and sboremove.

  Status: Post-ouput warning added for sbofind, sbocheck and
  "sboconfig --list". The other scripts listed above will be considered
  in the near future.

* Add a hint category for specifying pre-build commands

  Users may wish to run commands other than useradd and groupadd before
  building certain scripts. One usecase that comes to mind is sourcing
  profile scripts. This will be doable with either sbohints or direct
  sbotools.hints editing.

* sbofind: Add a flag to list all reverse dependencies

  This is potentially useful for maintenance-related testing.

* sboinstall, sboupgrade: Handle 'missing' scripts better on -current

  fourtysixandtwo helpfully pointed out that the "missing script" prompt
  can be confusing. Specifically, scripts that have been added to
  -current can be safely ignored without jeopardizing the build. Prompts
  for such scripts should be skipped. At least some renames will be
  accounted for; this appears to be mostly (exclusively?) an issue for
  Python scripts (python3-* to python-*, e.g.).

  Status: Never notify the user about out-of-tree scripts that are
  already installed. On -current, use a list of obsoleted scripts
  (renamed and added to Slackware, or known to be an unnecessary build-
  time dependency). There are over forty of these at present. The list
  is installed to /etc/sbotools and will be updated on the sbotools home
  page as necessary.

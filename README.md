# sbotools3

**sbotools3** is the continuation of **sbotools**. It is a set of Perl scripts providing a ports-like automation interface to [slackbuilds.org](https://slackbuilds.org). Features include dependency handling, using a custom git branch, generating 32-bit and compat32 builds on multilib systems, and more.

For online man pages and executive summaries of all commands, see [man](/man/). Downloads will soon be available in [downloads](/downloads/). A record of changes to **sbotools3** and **sbotools** back to version 1.9 can be found in [ChangeLog](/ChangeLog.html).

A debt of gratitude is owed to the original author, Jacob Pipkin, longtime maintainer Andreas Guldstrand and major contributor Luke Williams. This software would not exist without their efforts.

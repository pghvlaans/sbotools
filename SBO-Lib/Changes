2.0 - 2016-07-02
  * Major new features
    * LOCAL_OVERRIDES setting
      Allows to keep a directory with local slackbuild dirs that will override
      whatever is found in the regular repository.
       - https://github.com/pink-mist/sbotools/issues/8
       - https://github.com/pink-mist/sbotools/issues/13

       - https://github.com/pink-mist/sbotools/issues/19
       - https://github.com/pink-mist/sbotools/issues/20
    * SLACKWARE_VERSION setting
      Allows to specify the slackware version to sync from SBo. Previously only
      the version in your /etc/slackware-version was used for this, and if that
      had gotten updated in -current, you'd have needed to wait both for a new
      version of sbotools, as well as SBo to get the new repository online
      before sbotools would work for you again.
       - https://github.com/pink-mist/sbotools/issues/19
    * REPO setting
      This will override the SLACKWARE_VERSION setting. It's used to specify an
      absolute URL for the SBo repository you want to sync with.

# Development

Visit [pghvlaans/sbotools3](https://github.com/pghvlaans/sbotools3) for Issues, Pull Requests and the latest changes.

## Following Development

A separate repository called [sbotools3-git-slackbuild](https://github.com/pghvlaans/sbotools3-git-slackbuild) can be used to download a zip archive of (in principle) the latest commit on the `master` branch and make a Slackware package.

## Prospective Features

These features may be added in the future:

* Using (and generating?) `sqf` files
* Blacklist scripts
* "Classic Mode" setting for a more traditional `sbotools` look and feel

The above list is non-exhaustive and nothing on it is guaranteed to appear in `sbotools3`.

## Done for Version 1.2

* Run `sbocheck` without updating the tree (use `sbocheck -n`)
* `sbofind` reports installed reverse dependencies (use `sbofind -R`)

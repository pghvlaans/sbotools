Visit [pghvlaans/sbotools3](https://github.com/pghvlaans/sbotools3) for Issues, Pull Requests and the latest changes.

## Following Development

A separate repository called [sbotools3-git-slackbuild](https://github.com/pghvlaans/sbotools3-git-slackbuild) can be used to download a zip archive of (in principle) the latest commit on the `master` branch and make a Slackware package.

## Prospective Features

These features may be added in the future:

* Reverse dependency search
* Using (and generating?) `sqf` files
* Running `sbocheck` without updating the tree

The above list is non-exhaustive and nothing on it is guaranteed to appear in `sbotools3`.
